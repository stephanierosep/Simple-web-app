<i>simple shopping list web app - week 3 exercise at Makers</i>

This web app will allow users to add items to a shopping list, one item at a time. </br>
Upon clicking the add item button, it will redirect to a page containing added items. </br>
They will then be able to go back to the first browser page to add more items (via 'add another item' button).
